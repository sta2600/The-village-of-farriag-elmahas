<h4> The video is showing how men dance to celebrate a wedding</h4>
    <p>The wedding celebrations have many stages of celebration which begin a month before the wedding night. First the bride begins preparing 
    herself for this night by buying clothes, perfumes, body and hair care products, and many other things. 
    Then the bride’s family prepares perfume and mixes mixtures that are used for massage, 
    peeling the body perfumed clothes and rooms. Girls gather every day in the bride’s house 
    where they dance and sing. A week or two weeks before the wedding day, the family of the 
    groom and the family of the bride begin to prepare many kinds of pastries and sweets to 
    receive guests, and of course all members of the village help in every ceremony. Then, two days 
    before the wedding, during singing and people of the village gather, henna is placed on the 
    hands and feet of the groom, while the groom’s friends are content to put henna only on their 
    hands. On the same day a professional woman who know all about henna comes and put 
    henna on the hands and feet of the bride. The night before the wedding, they prepare for the 
    wedding meal, which is beef meat and other dishes that are prepared from vegetables. Finally, 
    the day of the wedding, the bride appears in a white dress with the groom in the middle of 
    singing the people of the village.</p>
