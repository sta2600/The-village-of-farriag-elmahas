    <dd>Before 2016 the village of Farriag was completely dark at the night accept few houses, because of the lack of 
    electricity in the village. Even the houses that were lit up at night, their residents were using 
    special machines that work by oil to generate electricity. Although there were not electric on 
    the village, the people there were happy and feeling that there were no other things they needed to 
    have.</dd>

    <dd>Then in 2016 the residents of the village of Farraig helped the government by donating 
    some money to the government, so the government can bring the electricity to the village and 
    that was the beginning of the development of the village. The stores begin to open, and 
    people bought a refrigerator so they can save their food. Also, people who live in the village of 
    Farriag began to watch TV and learn new things about the world around them. Many machines 
    entered the village after the electric, such as the washing machines, Iron and many things that 
    made the live of the people there much easier. Also, electricity helped agriculture and
